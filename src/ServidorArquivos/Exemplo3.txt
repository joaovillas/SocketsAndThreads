When this began I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find that 
I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me)
but all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own 
And the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
Like I'm close to something real.
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong 

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused)
looking everywhere only to find that it's
Not the way I had imagined it all in my mind.
(So what am I)
What do I have but negativity
Cause I can't justify the way 
everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own 
And the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong 

I will never know 
Myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel 
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
And I will break away 
I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel 
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong 

I wanna heal, I wanna to feel like 
I'm somewhere I belong 
I wanna heal, I want to feel like 
I'm somewhere I belong 
Somewhere I belong
